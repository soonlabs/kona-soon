kona-host is a CLI application that runs the Kona pre-image server and client program. The host
can run in two modes: server mode and native mode. In server mode, the host runs the pre-image
server and waits for the client program in the parent process to request pre-images. In native
mode, the host runs the client program in a separate thread with the pre-image server in the
primary thread.
